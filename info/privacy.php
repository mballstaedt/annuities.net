			<h4><b>Last updated January, 2023</b></h4>
			<p>This Privacy Policy describes how Annuities.net (“we”, “us, or “our”) collects, uses, shares, and secures your personal information in connection with our website, mobile applications, and other digital properties that link to this Privacy Policy (collectively, the “Sites”) and how we provide the Sites, educational materials, insurance coverage estimates and quotes, insurance brokerage services, estate planning tools, and other services (the “Services”) more broadly. It applies to information collected from and about you in connection with your use of the Sites and Services, as well as from other sources, such as over the telephone with our representatives or from third parties in connection with our Services, and not to External Sites (as defined below). By using the Sites and Services, you consent to the data practices described in this Policy.</p>
			<p>As providers of Services that involve the use of personal – and sometimes sensitive – information, protecting the confidentiality of that information is a top priority. This means we will never sell your personal information and we use industry standard technical, physical, administrative, and organizational controls, to ensure the security and confidentiality of your data! </p>
			<p>Our<a href="https://assets.ctfassets.net/3uw9cov4u60w/tBPdZkL4IMpaxgmGR5fzH/9517fb0ba84c9d04188f096f2bcb5d28/Policygenius_GLBA_Privacy_Notice__January_2022___1_.pdf"> </a>Privacy Policy applies to personal information we collect, use, and share in connection with offering you financial products or services (including insurance products and services), whether that information is obtained through our Sites, over the telephone, from third parties, or by any other lawful means. </p>
			<p>We may change this Privacy Policy at any time, and we take such steps as required by applicable law to notify you of any material changes. Your continued use of the Sites or Services following the update and notification means that you consent to our updated policy.</p>

			<h4><b>Usage and Sharing</b></h4>
			<p>We use information collected on and through the Sites for a variety of purposes in the course of business and as otherwise set forth herein. For example, such information may be used to process your applications to receive quotes or to send you a referral for a licensed advisor in your area. This information may also be used to evaluate what portions of the site are more popular than others, determine where visitors came from, where they go, and how long they stay on a particular page, or the site in general. We may match information collected from you through different means or at different times, and use such information along with information obtained from other sources, including third parties. </p>
			<p>Form data may be forwarded to a financial professional who may contact you by email, telephone, postal mail or other forms of communication. We are not responsible, and shall not be liable, if an agent, broker or company to whom we forward your data to violates our Privacy Policy or their own privacy policy, if any.</p>
			<p>We may disclose your information to companies that perform technology or marketing services for us.

We also reserve the right to disclose any information concerning you if required by law or to protect or defend our rights or the rights or well-being of our users or if you are involved (or are reasonably suspected to be involved) in any illegal activity, even without a subpoena, warrant or court order.</p>



			<h4><b>Consent to Processing</b></h4>
			<p>By providing any personal information to this site, you fully understand and unambiguously consent to the transfer of such personal information to, and the collection and processing of such personal information in the United States. </p>
			<p>By submitting this information you are authorizing a licensed; Advisor, Agent, and/or Insurance Professional in the financial services business to contact you directly with quotes, questions or information via telephone, fax, and email, regardless of the presence of your phone number(s) on any local or national no-call list.

			<h4><b>How We Secure Your Information</b></h4>
			<p>We maintain commercially reasonable administrative, physical and technical safeguards designed to prevent any unauthorized use, access, destruction, loss, alteration, or disclosure of your data. </p>
			<p>While we take commercially reasonable steps to protect your data we cannot guarantee perfect security – no internet-based service can. No security system is impenetrable. Despite our security measures, we cannot guarantee the security of our databases, nor can we guarantee that the information you supply will not be intercepted while being transmitted to and from us over the Internet. </p>




			<h4><b>Cookies</b></h4>
			<p>As is standard practice on many websites, we use cookies. </p>
			<p>A cookie is a small file containing an identifier (a string of letters and numbers) that is sent by a web server to a web browser and is stored by the browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server. </p>
			<p>Cookies may be either “persistent” cookies or “session” cookies: a persistent cookie will be stored by a web browser and will remain valid until its set expiry date, unless deleted by the user before the expiry date; a session cookie, on the other hand, will expire at the end of the user session, when the web browser is closed. We use both persistent and session cookies on our website. </p>

			<p>We do not link the information we store in cookies to any personally identifiable information you submit while on our site. </p>

			<p>Most browsers allow you to refuse to accept and/or to delete cookies already stored on your computer. However, blocking and/or deleting cookies will have a negative impact on the usability of many websites, including ours. </p>



			<h4><b>Children’s Privacy</b></h4>
			<p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 18 (“Children”). </p>
			<p>We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 18. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your Children has provided us with Personal Data, please contact us. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Data from children without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers.</p>


			<h4><b>External Sites</b></h4>
			<p>The Sites may contain links to third-party websites, including, without limitation, the websites of the insurance carriers offering the third-party insurance products made available to you through the Services (“External Sites”), but we do not endorse, and we are not responsible for the content of any linked External Sites or for the privacy practices of the third parties that own and operate such sites. Before using any External Site, please refer to the terms of use and privacy policies of the External Sites for more information, as those terms and policies govern your use of such External Sites. </p>


			<h4><b>Your Acceptance of this Policy</b></h4>
