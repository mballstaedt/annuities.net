Annuities are considered low-risk, and can provide guaranteed, monthly income when                you retire. There are many types of annuities with varying features & benefits. These include: fixed,                variable, immediate, deferred & hybrid. We strongly suggest you consult with a financial professional to                help you understand the various types of annuities before you purchase.            </div>        </div>        <div class="clr"></div>    </div>    <div class="p-main-text-box">        <div class="left-div">            <img height="75px" width="75px" alt="certified" src="https://offers.annuities.com/images/NestEgg-dollars.jpg">        </div>        <div class="right-div">            <div class="p-main-text-heading">Is an Annuity Right for You?</div>            <div class="p-main-text-decription">                Annuities are NOT a good fit for everyone. Annuities are designed for people looking for                guaranteed, monthly income when they retire - they are NOT a high-risk / high-return investment. They                are considered to be in the mainstream of conservative retirement planning - over $225 billion in                annuities have been purchased in the past 12 months alone!            </div>        </div>        <div class="clr"></div>    </div>    <div class="p-main-text-box">        <div class="left-div">            <img height="75px" width="75px" alt="certified" src="https://offers.annuities.com/images/About-Us green.jpg">        </div>        <div class="right-div">            <div class="p-main-text-heading">Who is Annuities.com?</div>            <div class="p-main-text-decription">                For years, Annuities.com has provided objective, unbiased annuity information to consumers                interested in making the right choices with their retirement savings.
